# Deep Mouse
The code base for simulating learning in the mouse brain visual cortex using anatomically-guided deep neural networks

## Requirements
* PyTorch 1.1.0

## Todo
- [ ] Make class design document with class signature information (input, output, instantiation parameters)
- [ ] Design Conv-LSTM class structure
- [ ] Design Layer/Lamina class
- [ ] Design region class
- [ ] Prepare MNIST video sequence for training network
- [ ] Prepare a 2-region 6-layer network and train on MNIST-video-task

## Important Papers (make new folder to keep track of literature)
* [Higher-Order Areas of the Mouse Visual Cortex](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-vision-102016-061331)
* [Approximating the Architecture of Visual Cortex in a Convolutional Network](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/neco_a_01211)
